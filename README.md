Created by: Mary Beth Ingram and Kat Leight

HIKESELECTOR is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that allows a user to login, view hikes, and keep a list of favorite hikes. It's the only hiking app you'll ever need again. EVER. Maybe.
 

## SUMMARY
Hiking is a popular activity for Colorado Residents. Choosing a hike can be more work than going on the hike itself! Skip the agonizing and use HIKESELCTOR. 
This app allows a user to login with a user name and password. 
A new user will be prompted to create a new user name and password.
The user can view and select hikes based on a variety of filters. 
The user can view the details of a selected hike. 
When viewing a hike's details, the user is given the option to save that hike to a list of favorite hikes.
The user can view their favorite hikes.
When viewing their favorite hikes, a user can choose to remove any hike from their favorites list. 
When a user is done choosing a hike or reviewing their favorites, they can exit the application. 
User name, password, and favorite hikes are stored in a SQLite3 database, so the information is stored from session to session.
